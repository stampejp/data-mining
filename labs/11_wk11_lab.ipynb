        "Welcome to Week 11! This lab introduces you to tree-based machine learning methods—decision trees and random forests—along with techniques for understanding which features drive your model's predictions. You'll learn how these powerful algorithms automatically discover non-linear patterns and interactions in data, making them invaluable tools for real-world business applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today's lab has two distinct parts: First, your TA will walk through a complete analysis using the Boston housing dataset, demonstrating how to build, evaluate, and interpret tree-based models. Then, you'll apply these techniques independently to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, building on your classification work from Week 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
        "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
        "- Build and interpret decision tree models for regression and classification problems\n",
        "- Construct random forest models and tune key hyperparameters\n",
        "- Compare model performance to select the best approach for a given problem\n",
        "- Calculate and interpret feature importance using permutation importance\n",
        "- Create and interpret partial dependence plots to understand feature effects\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📚 This Lab Reinforces\n",
        "- **Chapter 25: Decision Trees - Foundations and Interpretability**\n",
        "- **Chapter 26: Random Forests - Ensemble Power and Robustness**\n",
        "- **Chapter 27: Understanding Feature Importance**\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🕐 Estimated Time & Structure\n",
        "**Total Time:** 75 minutes  \n",
        "**Mode:** TA-led demonstration + group work (serves as homework)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **[0–30 min]** Part 1: TA walkthrough with Boston housing data\n",
        "- **[30–35 min]** Class Q&A and transition\n",
        "- **[35–70 min]** Part 2: Independent group challenges with Breast Cancer data\n",
        "- **[70–75 min]** Wrap-up and reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "You are encouraged to work in small groups of **2–4 students** for Part 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💡 Why This Matters\n",
        "Tree-based methods are among the most widely used machine learning algorithms in business. Unlike linear models that assume straight-line relationships, decision trees and random forests automatically discover complex patterns, threshold effects, and feature interactions. Banks use them for credit risk assessment, hospitals for readmission prediction, and retailers for customer churn modeling. Feature importance techniques help you understand *why* your model makes certain predictions—critical for building stakeholder trust, debugging models, and making data-driven business decisions."

        "- Why did the random forest outperform the single decision tree?\n",
        "- What does feature importance tell us that model performance metrics don't?\n",
        "- How would you explain a partial dependence plot to a non-technical stakeholder?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common questions:**\n",
        "- *\"How do I choose max_depth for a decision tree?\"* → Start with smaller values (3-10) and increase if needed. Too deep = overfitting.\n",
        "- *\"How many trees should I use in a random forest?\"* → Typically 100-500. More trees = better performance but diminishing returns.\n",
        "- *\"What's the difference between impurity-based and permutation importance?\"* → Impurity is faster but biased toward high-cardinality features; permutation is more reliable but slower."

        "- **Work in groups of 2-4 students** and collaborate\n",
        "- **Ask the instructor for help** if you get stuck\n",

        "   - All random forest configurations (Challenge 3)\n",
        "2. Compare them on test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score\n",
        "3. **If multiple models have identical performance**, consider these tiebreaker factors:\n",
        "   - **Computational efficiency**: Fewer trees = faster predictions\n",
        "   - **Training time**: Simpler models train faster\n",
        "   - **Model complexity**: Simpler is better when performance is equal\n",
        "4. Select ONE model to use for Challenges 5 & 6 (choose the model with the **highest recall**)\n",
        "   - **Real-World Insight:** In practice, when models perform identically, we prefer **simpler/faster models**. A model with 100 trees that has 0.922 recall is better than a 500-tree model with the same recall—it's faster to train, faster to deploy, and easier to maintain.\n",

        "- Did you notice multiple random forests achieving the same performance? Why might this happen?\n",
        "- Given that missing a malignant tumor is more serious than a false alarm, why is **recall** the most important metric?\n",
        "- If RF1 (100 trees) and RF4 (500 trees) perform identically, which would you choose and why?\n",
        "- Would you recommend this model for clinical use? What would you want to improve?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint:** Chapter 26 discusses why random forests typically outperform single trees (ensemble averaging reduces overfitting). When choosing between tied models, consider the \"Occam's Razor\" principle: simpler is better when performance is equal."

        "### Challenge 6 — Create and Interpret Partial Dependence Plot\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question:** Create a partial dependence plot (PDP) for the most important feature from Challenge 5 to understand HOW it influences cancer predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Task:**\n",
        "1. Identify the #1 most important feature from Challenge 5\n",
        "2. Create a partial dependence plot for this feature using your best random forest\n",
        "3. Interpret the plot by answering:\n",
        "   - As this feature increases, does malignancy probability increase or decrease?\n",
        "   - Is the relationship linear or non-linear?\n",
        "   - Are there any threshold effects (sudden changes)?\n",
        "   - What does this tell us about cancer diagnosis?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Clinical Interpretation:** If the most important feature is something like `radius_mean` (cell size), you might find that larger cells are associated with higher cancer probability. This aligns with medical knowledge that cancerous cells often grow larger than normal cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hint:** Chapter 27, \"Exploring Prediction Behavior Across Variables\" section explains PDPs:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from sklearn.inspection import PartialDependenceDisplay\n",
        "PartialDependenceDisplay.from_estimator(\n",
        "    model, X_train, features=['feature_name']\n",
        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Remember:** PDPs show the average predicted probability across all observations as we vary one feature."

        "\n",
        "### ✅ What You Accomplished\n",
        "\n",
        "Congratulations! In this lab, you:\n",
        "- **Built decision tree models** and explored how max_depth affects the bias-variance tradeoff\n",
        "- **Constructed random forest models** and tuned multiple hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, max_features)\n",
        "- **Compared model performance** across different configurations to select the best approach\n",
        "- **Calculated permutation importance** to identify which features drive cancer predictions\n",
        "- **Created partial dependence plots** to understand how features influence malignancy probability\n",
        "- **Applied tree-based methods** to a real medical classification problem\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "Take 2-3 minutes to consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Comparison**: Why did random forests outperform single decision trees? What advantage comes from combining many trees?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Importance**: Which cell characteristics were most predictive of cancer? Do these align with medical knowledge about cancer cells?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpretability vs. Accuracy**: Decision trees are easier to visualize than random forests. Is the accuracy gain from random forests worth the loss of interpretability for medical diagnosis?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Business Impact**: How would you explain your model's predictions to a physician who doesn't have data science training? What role do PDPs play in building trust?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Actionable vs. Predictive**: Some features are important for prediction but not actionable (e.g., cell radius_mean). How does this distinction matter for clinical decision-making?\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔗 Connection to Course Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab bridges several key data science concepts:\n",
        "- **Supervised learning**: Classification with tree-based methods\n",
        "- **Model evaluation**: Comparing models using multiple metrics\n",
        "- **Interpretability**: Understanding what drives predictions\n",
        "- **Business application**: Medical diagnosis where false negatives have serious consequences\n",
        "\n",
        "Tree-based methods are among the most widely used algorithms in practice because they:\n",
        "- Handle non-linear relationships automatically\n",
        "- Require minimal data preprocessing\n",
        "- Provide feature importance insights\n",
        "- Work well out-of-the-box with minimal tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📋 Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Homework**: This lab serves as your Week 11 homework. Make sure all challenges are complete and well-documented.\n",
        "- **Next Week**: We'll explore gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM) which often outperform random forests by building trees sequentially rather than independently.\n",
        "- **Additional Practice**: Try applying these techniques to other datasets from previous weeks (Default, Ames housing, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "**💾 Save your work** and ensure all code cells run successfully from top to bottom!"

        "\n",
        "**Issue 1: \"ImportError: cannot import name 'permutation_importance'\"**\n",
        "- **Solution:** Make sure you're using scikit-learn version 0.22 or higher. Update with: `pip install --upgrade scikit-learn`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Issue 2: \"My decision tree has 100% training accuracy but poor test accuracy\"**\n",
        "- **Solution:** This is overfitting! Your tree is too deep. Try:\n",
        "  - Reducing `max_depth` to 5-10\n",
        "  - Increasing `min_samples_split` to 20-50\n",
        "  - Increasing `min_samples_leaf` to 10-20\n",
        "\n",
        "**Issue 3: \"Random forest takes a long time to train\"**\n",
        "- **Solution:** This is normal for large forests. Speed it up by:\n",
        "  - Reducing `n_estimators` (100 is usually sufficient)\n",
        "  - Adding `n_jobs=-1` to use all CPU cores\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Check shapes**: Always verify `X_train.shape`, `y_train.shape` match expectations\n",
        "2. **Print intermediate results**: Don't wait until the end to check if things work\n",
        "3. **Start simple**: Build one model successfully before trying multiple configurations\n",
        "4. **Read error messages carefully**: They often tell you exactly what's wrong\n",
        "5. **Use RANDOM_STATE consistently**: This ensures reproducible results for debugging\n",
        "6. **Refer to the chapters**: The code examples in Chapters 25-27 show complete working syntax\n",

        "### Getting Help:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're stuck:\n",
        "1. Re-read the relevant chapter section mentioned in the challenge hint\n",
        "2. Check the Part 1 TA walkthrough for similar code patterns\n",
        "3. Ask your group members or neighboring groups\n",
        "4. Raise your hand and ask the instructor\n",
        "5. Post on Canvas discussion board with your specific error message"
